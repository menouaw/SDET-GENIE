![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ecb2a9-0638-4dee-b630-74aed4e95326)

## üöÄ Project Overview

SDET-GENIE is a cutting-edge, AI-powered Quality Assurance (QA) automation framework that revolutionizes the software testing process. Leveraging a suite of specialized AI agents, SDET-GENIE transforms rough user stories into comprehensive, executable test automation code through a seamless end-to-end process.

The framework integrates five powerful AI agents working in sequence:

1. **User Story Enhancement Agent** - Transforms rough ideas into detailed JIRA-style user stories
2. **Manual Test Case Agent** - Converts enhanced user stories into comprehensive test cases
3. **Gherkin Scenario Agent** - Transforms test cases into structured Gherkin feature files
4. **Browser Agent** - Executes Gherkin scenarios in real browsers and captures interaction data
5. **Code Generation Agent** - Produces ready-to-run automation code in multiple frameworks

## üåü Key Features

## üåà Acknowledgments

- Inspired by the challenges in modern software quality assurance
- Powered by cutting-edge AI technologies
- Enhanced with the browser-use library for advanced browser automation capabilities

## How it works:

```
1. Entrypoint: User provides a rough user story about what to test in the website.

2. User Story Enhancement:
   - The User Story Enhancement Agent transforms the rough user story into a detailed, JIRA-style user story
   - Adds proper structure (WHO, WHAT, WHY), acceptance criteria, and implementation notes

3. Manual Test Case Generation:
   - The Manual Test Case Agent converts the enhanced user story into comprehensive test cases
   - Generates positive, negative, edge, and boundary test scenarios with detailed steps

4. Gherkin Scenario Generation:
   - The Gherkin Agent transforms manual test cases into well-structured Gherkin scenarios
   - Creates feature files with proper Given/When/Then syntax and scenario outlines

5. Browser Automation:
   - The Browser Agent executes each Gherkin scenario in a real browser
   - Custom actions registered:
     -> "Get XPath of element using index"
     -> "Get element property"
     -> "Perform element action"
   - Executes and collects results:
     history = await browser_agent.run()

6. Data Collection from Browser:
   - Collects XPaths, actions, and extracted content from browser interactions
   - Saves combined history to session state:
     st.session_state.history = {
         "urls": history.urls(),
         "action_names": history.action_names(),
         "detailed_actions": all_actions,
         "element_xpaths": element_xpath_map,
         "extracted_content": all_extracted_content,
         "errors": history.errors(),
         "model_actions": history.model_actions(),
         "execution_date": st.session_state.get("execution_date", "Unknown")
     }

7. Test Automation Code Generation:
   - The Code Generation Agent produces ready-to-execute test automation code
   - Uses Gherkin scenarios and browser interaction data to generate code
   - Supports multiple frameworks (Selenium, Playwright, Cypress, etc.)
   - automation_code = generator_function(
         generated_steps,  # Generated Gherkin scenarios
         history           # Browser interaction data
     )
```
